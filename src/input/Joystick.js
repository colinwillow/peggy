// Virtual thumbstick.
//
// Ported forward from Robits, which got this right after a lot of play-testing.
// The parts that are load-bearing and should not be "simplified" away:
//
//  * FLOATING mode. The stick's centre is wherever your thumb first lands
//    inside a big invisible zone, not a fixed circle you have to find. On a
//    phone you never look at your thumbs, so a fixed stick means constantly
//    re-finding it. Fixed mode is kept as an option because some people prefer
//    a stick that stays put, and it parks the knob where you last used it.
//
//  * FLICK PEAK LATCH. A fast flick can peak and return between two frames —
//    at 30fps that happens constantly — and a per-frame sample misses it
//    entirely, so the gesture "doesn't register". We latch the strongest
//    deflection seen since the consumer last read it, so a flick lands at any
//    frame rate.
//
//  * TAP vs PUSH. A short touch that never travels is a tap (jump), separate
//    from a push (move). Both live on the same thumb, which is how you fit
//    twin-stick + jump onto a screen with no buttons.
//
//  * Touch identifier tracking. Multi-touch is the whole point; without
//    matching identifiers the two sticks steal each other's fingers.

const TAP_MAX_PUSH = 0.4;    // and it must never have deflected past this

// ── THE FOUR GESTURES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// One thumb, four verbs, told apart by deflection over time. This is what lets
// the right stick carry camera + jump + melee + hook without a single button.
//
//   TAP      down, barely moved, up fast              -> jump
//   HOLD     down, stays near centre, up after a beat -> throw the hook
//   FLICK    snapped out FAST and far                 -> melee
//   PUSH     out and sustained                        -> steer the camera
//
// TAP and HOLD are the same motion separated only by duration; FLICK and PUSH
// are the same motion separated only by speed. Both splits are reliable because
// a human doing one is not close to the threshold of the other.
const HOLD_MIN_MS = 220;     // past a tap, and it must have stayed near centre
// Generous on purpose. A thumb resting on glass for half a second wanders more
// than you'd think, and at 0.30 (19px of a 64px stick) ordinary wobble was
// disqualifying the hold — so the hook simply never fired. This same value is
// the camera's deadzone, so anywhere inside it is guaranteed camera-neutral.
const HOLD_MAX_PUSH = 0.38;
// A flick is defined by SPEED, not by "got far within a time window".
//
// The window version fired on ordinary camera drags: it started its clock the
// moment the thumb passed 30% deflection, and getting from 30% to 60% inside
// 230ms is something a deliberate drag does easily. Push and flick became the
// same gesture.
//
// Radial speed separates them cleanly. A real flick covers most of the stick in
// 60-90ms, so ~10-15 units/sec. A deliberate camera drag is 2-4 units/sec. The
// threshold sits in the empty middle.
const FLICK_MAG = 0.55;      // how far out it must get
const FLICK_SPEED = 6.0;     // deflection units per second — the arming test
const FLICK_RESET = 0.30;    // fall back inside this to re-arm the next flick
const FLICK_MUTE_MS = 260;   // camera ignores this stick briefly after a flick

// ── THE CAMERA IS SWIPE-BASED, AND WHY THAT MATTERS ────────────────────────
// The camera pans with thumb MOVEMENT (pixels of travel), not with held
// deflection. This is the change that makes hold-to-aim work the way a hand
// expects: once the pan is delta-based, a thumb that is out-and-STILL is doing
// nothing to the camera — so that posture is free to mean "aiming the hook in
// this direction", which is exactly the press-hold-release-to-launch gesture.
// Rate-based panning could never allow it: held deflection WAS the camera.
//
// A fast pan and a flick are both fast, so the flick can't fire the instant it
// crosses the threshold — it becomes a CANDIDATE, and resolves on what happens
// next: released or snapped back quickly -> melee; still travelling after
// 200ms -> it was a pan all along. Camera deltas are buffered while a
// candidate is open (and for the first beat of every touch), then dropped on a
// flick or flushed to the camera on a pan — so a melee never whips the view
// and a pan loses nothing, it just starts a breath late.
const CAND_TIMEOUT_MS = 200; // candidate still travelling after this = a pan
const CAND_REBOUND = 0.12;   // deflection fallback from peak that fires the flick
const SWIPE_BUFFER_MS = 110; // deltas buffered at touch start, pending a verdict
const AIM_STILL_MS = 200;    // this long without above-slop movement

// ── SHOOT MODE (opts.shootStick) ───────────────────────────────────────────
// The right stick IS the gun, and TOUCHING it pulls the trigger: any press
// that outlives a tap starts shooting straight ahead, and a deliberate push
// engages instantly. Once shooting, deflection past the dead-band AIMS
// (twin-stick look, handled upstream) — so springing back to centre holds
// the aim and keeps firing, and only LIFTING the thumb lets go. Tap and
// flick keep their verbs (jump, melee); the swipe-camera and the aim-hold
// gave their thumb-territory to the trigger. A fast snap still becomes a
// flick candidate first, so a melee flick never fires a stray shot — the
// trigger engages only once the candidate window has passed (or immediately
// on a deliberate, non-snap push).
